                <p>
                  This privacy policy applies to the Pot-Tac-Toe app (hereby
                  referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was
                  created by Potato Developer (hereby referred to as "Service
                  Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use
                  "AS IS".
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  The Application does not obtain any information when you
                  download and use it. Registration is not required to use the
                  Application.

                </p>
                <p>
                  This Application does not collect precise information about
                  the location of your mobile device.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Since the Application does not collect any information, no
                  data is shared with third parties.
                </p>

                <p><br /><strong>What are my opt-out rights?</strong></p>
                <p>
                  You can stop all collection of information by the Application
                  easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall
                  processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or
                  via the mobile application marketplace or network.
                </p>

                <p><br /><strong>Children</strong></p>
                <p>
                  The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or
                  market to children under the age of 13.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally
                  identifiable information from children. The Service Provider
                  encourages all children to never submit any personally
                  identifiable information through the Application and/or
                  Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal
                  guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to
                  help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never
                  to provide personally identifiable information through the
                  Application and/or Services without their permission. If you
                  have reason to believe that a child has provided personally
                  identifiable information to the Service Provider through the
                  Application and/or Services, please contact the Service
                  Provider (93mas.bram@gmailc.om) so that they will be able to
                  take the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years
                  of age to consent to the processing of your personally
                  identifiable information in your country (in some countries we
                  may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
                </p>

                <p><br /><strong>Security</strong></p>
                <p>
                  The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the
                  confidentiality of your information. However, since the
                  Application does not collect any information, there is no risk
                  of your data being accessed by unauthorized individuals.
                </p>

                <p><br /><strong>Changes</strong></p>
                <p>
                  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any
                  reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to
                  their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new
                  Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy
                  regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval
                  of all changes.
                </p>

                <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-10-18</p>

                <p><br /><strong>Your Consent</strong></p>
                <p>
                  By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing

                  Application, or have questions about the practices, please
