Login Page
It's a common practice to create a separate login page that takes the entire viewport. You can utilize one half of the page by placing a brand related image in it, and put your login inputs in a second column by using the Bootstrap grid.

Login Template
Putting your brand logo on the login page is a great practice, in addition to a logo you can also add a mission statement or other text like in the example below. If you want to create a beautiful background for your text that will match your brand colors use our gradient generator.

Sign in form
This is another variation of a sign in form, this one puts emphasis on social account login options by making the social account buttons as wide as the main sign in button.

Login Card
You can use the card component to make your sign in card stand out with a subtle shadow and rounded corners.

Sign up page
A sign up page is different than a login page because it is used to create a new account, not to sign the user into an existing account.

You should consider adding more input fields to your registration pages. The example below uses additional inputs for first and last name. Other commonly used inputs are address forms, credit card and payment related inputs or even different varieties of survey forms in case you need to gather more data during registration.

Registration page
Once again, the example below is a signup not a signin form. This one uses the glassmorphism effect along with minimalistic social media icons.

Sign up example
The last sign up example doesn't use columns. Instead it is embedded inside of a jumbotron card that spans the entire width of the signup page.
